## General Equipment Scheduling Guidelines

1. **Check Schedule Before Booking**:
   - Before scheduling any appointment requiring specialized equipment, check the entire day's schedule to ensure no conflicts
   - If a conflict exists, offer alternative times or days

2. **Equipment Maintenance Blocks**:
   - Be aware of scheduled maintenance times for equipment
   - No appointments requiring specific equipment should be scheduled during maintenance blocks

3. **Technical Issues Protocol**:
   - If equipment is reported as non-functional, immediately block the schedule for that equipment
   - Contact the office manager or designated staff member to address the issue
   - Reschedule affected patients if necessary

4. **Schedule Buffer Time**:
   - When possible, allow 15-minute buffers between appointments requiring the same equipment
   - This accommodates potential delays and ensures smooth clinic flow

5. **Patient No-Show Protocol**:
   - If a patient misses an appointment requiring specialized equipment, document in their chart
   - This equipment time can be used for emergent cases if needed

## Scheduling Priority Guidelines

1. **Emergency Cases**: Always highest priority for equipment usage
2. **Post-operative Patients**: Second priority 
3. **Established Patients**: Third priority
4. **New Patients**: Scheduled based on remaining availability
