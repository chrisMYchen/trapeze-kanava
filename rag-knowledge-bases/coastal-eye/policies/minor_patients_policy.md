## Scheduling Guidelines for Minor Patients

1. **Appointment Timing**

   - Allow extra time in scheduling (add 5-10 minutes to standard appointment duration)

   - Ask guardian to bring:
     - Child's current glasses (if applicable)
     - List of current medications
     - Any relevant medical records or referrals
     - Insurance information

3. **Verification Questions During Scheduling**
   - "How old is the patient?" (Verify meets minimum age requirement)
   - "Will a parent or legal guardian be present for the entire appointment?"
   - "Does the child have any special needs we should be aware of?"
   - "Has the child had an eye exam before? If yes, when and where?"

## Special Considerations

   - Sunglasses recommended for after appointment

## Insurance and Billing for Minors
