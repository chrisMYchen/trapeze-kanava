# New Patient Booking Workflow

This document provides the step-by-step process for scheduling new patients at Coastal Eye.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Identify Patient Needs**
   - Ask about the reason for their visit
   - Determine if they need routine eye care or have a specific concern
   - Check if they have a referral from another doctor
   - Note any vision changes, pain, or emergency symptoms

2. **Provider Selection**
   - For general eye exams, refraction, contact lens fitting → Dr. Perdomo or Provider 2 (Optometrists)
   - For surgical evaluations, cataracts, retinal issues → Dr. Shakir (Ophthalmologist)
   - Check specific conditions against provider capabilities (see Condition Routing document)

3. **Insurance Verification**
   - Ask which insurance the patient has
   - For Medicaid/Husky patients:
     - Route to Dr. Perdomo or Provider 2
     - Do NOT book with Dr. Shakir for new patients
     - For established patients with Dr. Shakir history, initiate transfer of care

4. **Schedule Availability**
   - Dr. Perdomo: Monday to Friday
   - Provider 2: Monday to Friday with every other Friday off and every other Monday AM off
   - Dr. Shakir: Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays (Wednesdays are surgery days, Fridays AM only for SC and INJ appointments)

5. **Appointment Timing Guidelines**
   - **IMPORTANT FOR ALL PROVIDERS**: Do not book new patients in the last time slot before lunch or at the end of the day
   - Allocate appropriate time slots:
     - Dr. Perdomo: 20 minutes
     - Provider 2: 30 minutes
     - Dr. Shakir: 15 minutes

6. **Age Verification**
   - Verify patient's age
   - Dr. Perdomo: Minimum age 6 years
   - Dr. Shakir and Provider 2: Minimum age 7 years
   - Inform that all minor patients require a guardian present during the visit

7. **Preparation Instructions**
   - For IOL Master appointments with Dr. Shakir: If patient wears contact lenses, instruct to rest eyes for 3 days before appointment
   - For all patients: Bring current glasses, contact lens information, and any relevant medical records
   - For referred patients: Bring the referral documentation

8. **Confirmation**
   - Confirm appointment details with patient
   - Provide office location and arrival instructions
   - Inform about any required paperwork to complete before appointment
