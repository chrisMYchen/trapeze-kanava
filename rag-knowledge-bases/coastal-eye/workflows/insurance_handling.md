# Insurance Verification Workflow

This document outlines the process for verifying insurance coverage and routing patients based on their insurance.

## Insurance Verification Steps

1. **Initial Information Gathering**
   - Ask the patient for their insurance provider
   - Request their member ID and group number if available
   - Determine if they have vision insurance, medical insurance, or both

2. **Medicaid/Husky Insurance Protocol**
   - **Provider Routing**:
     - Dr. Perdomo: ACCEPTS Medicaid/Husky 
     - Second Optometrist: ACCEPTS Medicaid/Husky
     - Dr. Shakir: Does NOT accept Medicaid/Husky, especially for new patients
   - **For Existing Shakir Patients with New Medicaid/Husky Coverage**:
     - Initiate transfer of care protocol: "If you see an established patient with history with Dr. Shakir, commence transfer of care spiel"
     - Explain that Dr. Shakir no longer accepts their insurance
     - Offer to transfer their care to Dr. Perdomo or Second Optometrist

3. **Vision vs. Medical Insurance Determination**
   - **Vision Insurance** (covers routine eye exams, glasses, contacts):
     - Route to Dr. Perdomo or Second Optometrist
   - **Medical Insurance** (covers eye disease, injury, or medical conditions):
     - Route based on condition and provider availability
     - For surgical or specialty care, verify Dr. Shakir accepts their specific plan

4. **Out-of-Network Options**
   - If patient's insurance is not accepted, inform about out-of-pocket costs
   - Provide self-pay rate information when applicable
   - Explain potential for submitting for out-of-network reimbursement (if available)

5. **Insurance Verification for Specialized Services**
   - Contact lens fittings may have separate insurance considerations
   - Surgical procedures require pre-authorization
   - Visual field tests and other diagnostic tests may need to meet medical necessity criteria

## Common Insurance Scenarios

1. **Patient has separate vision and medical insurance**
   - Explain which insurance will be billed based on the reason for visit
   - For medical issues: medical insurance applies
   - For routine vision care: vision insurance applies

2. **Patient recently changed insurance to Medicaid/Husky**
   - Inform about provider change requirement if they previously saw Dr. Shakir
   - Emphasize continuity of care with other qualified providers

3. **Patient has Medicare**
   - Accepted by all providers
   - Explain potential need for supplemental insurance for certain services

4. **Patient has commercial insurance**
   - Verify specific plan acceptance
   - Check for any recent changes in network participation

## Insurance-Based Appointment Guidance

- When scheduling based on insurance, consider both provider acceptance and appointment type
- For combined medical and vision concerns, advise that separate appointments may be needed
- Inform patients about potential out-of-pocket costs for non-covered services
