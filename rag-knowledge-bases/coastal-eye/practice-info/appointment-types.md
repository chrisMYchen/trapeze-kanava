#### Post-Injection Information:
- Bloodshot eye is normal up to two weeks. Dr. Shakir explains: "That's where the needle goes through. It doesn't hurt or harm the eye at all. It will go away."

### Medical Hold Guidelines (EXCLUDING cataract surgery):
Patients are advised to pause from taking blood thinners before Ozurdex and Surgeries:
- Eliquis - 48 hours
- Aspirin - 7 days
- Warfarin and Coumadin - 5 days
- Xarelto - 48 hours
- Plavix - 5 days

Patients on these medications should refrain from taking them for the respective periods prior to surgery UNLESS otherwise instructed by the prescribing physician.

**Note**: During cataract surgery, the tissue planes that the surgeon enters are not very vascular, so there is no need to hold any blood thinners. However, the bleeding risk is higher during other types of procedures (retina, pterygium excision).

## LDT (Light Delivery Treatment)
- Also known as LAL Treatment (Light Adjustable Lens)
- **Device**: Light Delivery Device (LDD)
- **Schedule**: Book on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday (never on Wednesday as the LDD is inside the surgery suite)
- **Duration**:
  - 40 minutes for Dr. Perdomo
  - 60 minutes for Dr. Rao (30 minutes appointment duration)

## Visual Field
- **Description**: Visual field testing measures how much vision you have in either eye and how much vision loss may have occurred over time. The test can determine if you have blind spots (scotoma) in your vision and their size and shape, which can indicate how eye disease or a brain disorder is affecting your vision.
- **Applications**: Used to assess vision affected by glaucoma and to assess how vision may be limited by eyelid problems such as ptosis and droopy eyelids.
- **Patient Instructions**: Make sure patient brings their glasses/contact lenses

## Surgery
- **Important Note**: All surgeries are booked by the Surgical Coordinator (Bryan), never book it yourself. Verify the patient's profile - DOB, contact number, and email, gather preferred date of surgery or message for Meaghan like insurance coverage and cataract schedule.

### Surgery Types:
- **CE/IOL** - Cataract Extraction / Intraocular Lens
