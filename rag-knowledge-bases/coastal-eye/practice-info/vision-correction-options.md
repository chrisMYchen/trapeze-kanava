# Vision Correction Pathways - Coastal Eye

## Overview
Coastal Eye offers three primary pathways for vision correction, along with specialized surgical options. This document outlines each pathway to help guide patients to the most appropriate solution based on their age, eye health, and vision needs.

## Vision Correction Pathways

### 1. Cataract Surgery
- **Patient Eligibility**: Patients must have a cataract
- **Recommended Option**: Light Adjustable Lens Plus (LAL+)
  - Positioned as the best option in the world to correct vision during cataract surgery
  - Represents the best technology available
  - Coastal Eye is one of the few practices with the LAL+ early access program
- **Benefits**: Corrects vision during necessary cataract removal procedure

### 2. Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)
- **Patient Age Range**: Middle-aged patients, usually 45 to 65 years old
- **For Patients**: Without cataracts who want vision correction
- **Procedure**: Implants the LAL+ to fully correct vision including:
  - Distance vision
  - Reading vision
  - Astigmatism
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Permanent solution to vision problems
  - Patients will never develop cataracts later in life after RLE (strong selling point)
- **Terminology Note**: Previously called Custom Lens Replacement (CLR), now transitioning to RLE terminology
- **Scheduling Information**: 
  - Anyone over 45 calling for "LASIK consult" or other vision correction should be told we offer everything but need to see doctor in consultation
  - Appointment reason should be noted as "RLE consult"

### 3. EVO ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens)
- **Patient Age Range**: Younger patients, 18 to 45 years old
- **Benefits**:
  - Fixes distance and reading vision
  - Eliminates astigmatism
  - Better than LASIK since no permanent alteration to the eye
  - Safer, newer approach that doesn't cause dry eye like LASIK
  - Fully reversible procedure (implant can be removed later in life)
- **Comparative Note**: LASIK patients still develop cataracts later in life, so there is no permanent vision correction with LASIK

### 4. PPV (Pars Plana Vitrectomy) - 27G
- **Note**: Other practices use 25G or 23G
- **Application**: Used for floater removal and other retinal procedures
- **Distinguishing Feature**: Smaller gauge (27G) offers potential benefits compared to larger gauges used elsewhere

## Provider Recommendations

### Dr. Omar Razzique Shakir, MD, MBA (Ophthalmologist)
- **Specialty**: Surgical vision correction procedures
- **Procedures Performed**:
  - Cataract Surgery with LAL+
  - Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)
  - EVO ICL implantation
  - PPV (Floater Removal)
- **Consultation Required**: For surgical vision correction options

### Dr. Omar Perdomo, OD (Optometrist)
- **Role**: Initial evaluation and post-operative care
- **Services**:
  - Comprehensive eye examinations
  - Post-surgery follow-up care

## Patient Guidance
- Patients interested in vision correction should be scheduled for a consultation with the appropriate provider based on their age and eye conditions
- Younger patients (18-45) without cataracts should be informed about EVO ICL options
- Middle-aged patients (45-65) without cataracts should be directed to RLE consultations
- Patients with cataracts should be scheduled for cataract surgery consultations with information about LAL+ options
